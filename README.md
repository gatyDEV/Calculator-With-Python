# Calculator-With-Python
Calculator Project
This calculator was made in Python. To use it, you need:

Python installed
The Colorama library installed
A text editor to open and edit the scripts
A terminal to run and test the program
Remember, this is just a tutorial on how to create a calculator.
I also included the scripts so you can better understand how it works.

The project is modifiable, so you can customize:

The GUI
The internal code
Additional operations
Think of it as a base to build upon.
